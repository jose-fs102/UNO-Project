# UNO-Project
Programming II Class Project

Author: Jose Rivera

This was one of my first school projects. I was given a set of code and my task was to finish it and turn it into a 
functional game of UNO.

This really taught me about classes and how to communicate between class in C++. It also taught me how to
create a game using the console.
